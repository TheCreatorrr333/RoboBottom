# RoboBottom
A remake of **[RoboTop](https://robotop.xyz)**'s reminder system. RoboTop was originally made by **[Colon](https://gdcolon.com)** <img style="width: 15px; height: 15px;" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1132968267963715634.webp?size=64&name=fluff&quality=lossless"></img>. I only remade the reminders part of that bot because of its shutdown on August 12th 2023. RIP RoboTop, You will be missed!

## Usage & Notes
```
py robotop.py
```
On **Windows** a `db` folder is created in the current directory which holds all reminder data\
On **Non-Windows** it tries to go back two directories and create a `RoboBottomDB` folder there
